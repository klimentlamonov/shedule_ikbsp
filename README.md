### What is it? 
:hushed:
This project was created specifically for students of the Russian 
Technological University (RTU) of the Institute for Integrated Security 
and Special Instrumentation (IKBiSP).

- The service monitors the page with the schedule for the students of IKBiSP 
and provides it in a readable form.

>*Service functionality can be expanded...*

### How it works?
:construction_worker:
The institute's schedule is presented in the form of a .xlsx file The service
 checks the schedule for changes every day 
and if changes are found, it informs about it and update data.
